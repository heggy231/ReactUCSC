UCSC classroom exercise

3 important react
- react component  based: view, panel, 
- one-way data flow ()

## react https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/What-React/519668/542812-4.html
- spa, fb, Virtual DOM
- functional programming, Immutability (function composition vs create obj orientation js programming paradigm)
- new lib for dev user interfaces
- Why React so fast? DOM rendering spead (DOM: structure of HTML elements that make up
  webpage, Also refers to API for how these page elements are accessed and changed)
    - reading/writing to DOM is slow vs. read/write JS obj faster
    - React has virtual DOM (JS obj) that writes to browser DOM > only when it needs to
    - Never reads from real DOM
    ## cases of dealing with DOM  
      * DOM vs JS: back/forth relationship
      * DOM vs Backbone Views: re-render the same date over and over again
      JS > React Virtual DOM > JS logic
